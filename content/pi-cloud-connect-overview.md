# PI Cloud Connect overview

PI Cloud Connect makes it easy to share data between PI Systems, both inside and outside the enterprise with many advantages:

- Solution maintained and managed by OSIsoft with minimal on-prem footprint
	
- Scalable and reliable solution based on Microsoft Azure
	
- Configuration and monitoring accessible through a web-based customer portal that only requires a modern web browser
	
- Secure data sharing without requiring virtual private networks (VPNs)
	
- Seamless and simultaneous transfer of time-series data and metadata from your PI AF structures, enabling asset models in the PI System to be transferred
	
- Publish/subscribe architecture that supports one-to-many, many-to-one, and many-to-many data exchanges, which advantageously replaces point-to-point connections
