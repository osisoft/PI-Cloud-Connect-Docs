# Add user account

Add a user account. A user is an identity that has access to a PI Cloud Connect tenant.

Perform the following steps to add a user account.

## Procedure

1. Click **User Accounts** in the left navigation menu.

1. Under **Add user accounts**, add the user's first name, last name, and contact email, and then click **Add**.

   **Note:** The Identity Provider of the contact email does not have to match the Identity Provider selected for the user's account (a valid Microsoft account).

   The user will appear in the list of users.

   When a user account is added, an activation email is sent to validate the user identity. New users have 21 days to activate their account. Until the account is activated, a user's status is in a pending state. If a user does not activate within 21 days, you can resend the activation email by clicking on the user and then selecting **Edit User**.
