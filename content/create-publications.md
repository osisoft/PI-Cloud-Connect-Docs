# Create publications

Publications are created to enable the sharing of data between subscribers. A wizard enables users to select a data source, publication scope, publishing options, and publication name. Subscribers can also be added and removed from the Publication page.

**Note:** Prior to creating a publication, a PI Connect node must be configured from the System page so that a data source (one or more PI AF Servers) is available. See the [Download and install PI Cloud](xref:download-and-install) section for more information.
