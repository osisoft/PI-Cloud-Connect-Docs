# User accounts
   
PI Cloud Connect users sign in to the PI Cloud Connect portal using their company alias, and perform functions according to the roles they have been granted.

Once your account provisioning is complete, the initial user created by the provisioning process will receive an email at the email address provided. This email contains a hyperlink required to activate this first user. Activating the user account will also complete the activation of the account that has been created for the company. To ensure that the activation email is successfully received, verify that your email server did not block, filter or redirect the activation email as spam or junk. The hyperlink provided to activate the account is valid for 21 days after receipt of the email.
