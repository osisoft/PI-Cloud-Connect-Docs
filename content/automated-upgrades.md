# Automated upgrades

After the initial installation of PI Cloud Connect, OSIsoft automatically upgrades the service whenever a new release of PI Cloud Connect is available. PI Cloud Connect nodes must be connected or available to ensure that the upgrade process is successful. The automatic upgrade process does not require any manual interaction and only incurs a momentary delay in data. If for any reason your automatic upgrade fails, you will receive an email with machine-specific details and guidance on how to manually upgrade the local service. Otherwise, you will receive a notification of a successful upgrade. Releases may include new features and enhancements, bug fixes, and performance upgrades.
