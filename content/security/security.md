# Security

PI Cloud Connect deploys several levels of security to keep your information secure and still allow users access to the data they need. Security levels include: infrastructure level, account level, sign-in level, and user level.

- At the infrastructure level: PI Cloud Connect uses the HTTP protocol in conjunction with Transport Layer Security (TLS) 1.2 to form an HTTPS connection for the secure encryption of all in-transit data. PI Cloud Connect authenticates calls between the customer portal using Microsoft Accounts in conjunction with OSIsoftâ€™s access control services. PI Cloud Connect also makes secure calls to the PI Data Archive and PI AF utilizing "claims-aware" tokens. This allows the Windows service that runs on-premises to map the claims-aware security token that it receives from PI Cloud Connect to a Windows security token on-premises.

- At the account level: an account represents a company, partner, or affiliate that has signed up for the PI Cloud Connect. Each account is fully isolated from other accounts.

- At the sign-in level: to access PI Cloud Connect features, all users must sign in to their secure customer portal and authenticate using a Microsoft account.

- At the user level: When publishing data, the publisher decides which users have access to subscribe to publications. This is done on a per user basis, not a per account basis.

For additional information regarding the security configuration for the on-premises PI Connect service account, see [Download and install PI Cloud Connect](xref:download-and-install).
