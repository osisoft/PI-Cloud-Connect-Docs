# PI Cloud Connect pricing

## How much does PI Cloud Connect cost?
 
Pricing is based on the maximum number of configured subscriptions per account, per year. A subscription is defined as a data set associated with a corresponding publication. Both publications and subscriptions are defined and managed from the PI Cloud Connect Customer Portal.
 
Prices are determined by the following Commitment rates:
 <table><thead><tr><th>Small</th><th>Medium</th><th>Large</th>
  </tr></thead>
  <tbody><tr>
    <td>0 to 10 subscriptions</td><td>11 to 20 subscriptions</td><td>more than 20 subscriptions</td>
  </tr>    
  <tr>
    <td>$3000/year*</td><td>$5000/year</td><td>Contact Us</td>
  </tr>  
  <tr>
    <td colspan="3">Unlimited Publications</br>Three (3) months free trial period</td>
  </tr>
  </tbody></table>

(*) taxes may apply

The maximum number of configured subscriptions is aggregated across all users and all PI Connect nodes for each account. For the initial term, pricing is based on the anticipated usage for that term. For the following term, pricing is based on the actual consumption of the previous term.

The three (3) months free trial period starts when your account is first activated. Account activation takes place when the first user signs into the PI Cloud Connect Customer Portal for the first time. Please contact your account manager or email [picloudservices@osisoft.com](mailto:picloudservices@osisoft.com) for any inquiries regarding your exact activation date and the time left in your trial period.
