View Node information to see where PI Connect components have been deployed, or download the PI Cloud Connect Setup Kit.

The System page has two sections: Nodes and Download. The Node section lists the different on-prem nodes where PI Connect has been installed. The status icon indicates whether the PI Connect node has an active connection with the cloud components. The Download section is used for accessing the setup kit required to install PI Connect on an on-prem node.
