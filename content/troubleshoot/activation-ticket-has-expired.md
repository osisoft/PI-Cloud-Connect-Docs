# Activation ticket has expired

For security, activation needs to be completed within 48 hours after you receive the activation email. After that period, a new invitation will be re-issued for you to activate your account. A new activation email can be sent by any user from the same account from the Edit User option available on the User Accounts page of the Customer Portal. If you still have issues, contact [OSIsoft Technical Support](https://my.osisoft.com/) and specify your account name and user account for OSIsoft to resend an activation email.
