# Select data source

The Data Source step displays a list of the available `AFserver.AFDatabase` namespaces for each PI Connect node configured under your account. If a namespace is missing from the list, it is an indication that there is an issue either connecting to the PI Connect node from the cloud or connecting to PI AF from the PI Connect node.

**Note:** The Node User Account is the Windows service account provided during the installation of a PI Connect node.

**Note:** More details for the node user account are provided in the [Download and install PI Cloud Connect](xref:download-and-install) section of this document.

## Procedure

1. Select a data source from the list.

   - The Namespace column lists all `AFServer.AFDatabase` namespaces accessible from any of the Nodes configured for your account.

   - The Node column lists the name of the deployed PI Connect node for each namespace.

2. Click the **arrow button** at the bottom of the screen.
